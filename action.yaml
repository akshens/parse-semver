      Version tag, whether is a release or a pre-release.
      Is is guaranteed that `tag` output has a value.
      In case when the `version` is detected as a pre-release version,
      if there is an identifier provided in the `version`,
      e.g., using `--preid` option of `npm version` command,
      the provided identifier will be returned as the `tag`,
      otherwise, `dev` tag will be returned.
      And in case where the version is detected as a version (non-pre-release),
      the `tag` value will be `latest`.
